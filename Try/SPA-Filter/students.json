The painting is not so much a single view of a train platform, it is rather a component in larger project of a dozen canvases which attempts to portray all facets of the Gare Saint-Lazare. The paintings all have similar themes—including the play of light filtered through the smoke of the train shed, the billowing clouds of steam, and the locomotives that dominate the site. Of these twelve linked paintings, Monet exhibited between six and eight of them at the third Impressionist exhibition of 1877, where they were among the most discussed paintings exhibited by any of the artists.

Painted as part of series of dancing subjects, Ballet Rehearsal is the work of an artist who has become closely identified with the theme of capturing movement – more than half of all of his works depict dancers. Preferring to be identified as a Realist rather than an Impressionist, Degas captured the effects of bodily movement in the same way that Monet and Renoir replicated the shimmering effects of light on water. His works reveal a psychological depth and a profound sense of isolation and existential loneliness. (1st-art-gallery.com)",

His paintings of olive pickers demonstrate the relationship between man and nature by depicting one of the cycles of life, harvesting or death. It is also an example of how individuals, through interaction with nature, can connect with the divine. Van Gogh found respite and relief in interaction with nature. When the series of olive tree paintings was made in 1889 he was subject to illness and emotional turmoil, yet the paintings are considered to be among his finest works. (Wikipedia)",
